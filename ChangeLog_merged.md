# CarTiMapper Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.


### [v6.8.2] - Core Physics & UI Refinement Patch

**TimelineScrubber (v24.2.0):**
* **[UI-99]** Bound the `.timeline-axis` strictly to `position: sticky; bottom: 0;`. This magnetically anchors the time-ruler to the viewport glass, permanently preventing it from scrolling out of bounds on desktop.
* **[UI-100]** Implemented horizontal responsive hiding for minor ticks. If internal gap math evaluates to `< 28px` between minor ticks on Android/Mobile, the text nodes are natively stripped, preventing overlapping typographical illegibility while preserving the graphical ticks.
* **[UI-101]** Applied `display: flex; flex-grow: 1` to the track wrapper, forcing the swimlanes to claim 100% of available height on boot, eliminating the "top-stacking" collapse bug.
* **[UI-102]** Extracted the SVG Media indicator (`hasMedia`) and mathematically repositioned it *before* the narrative string, injecting a localized `6px` right-breather to improve cognitive scanning velocity.

**AppOrchestrator (v1.52.0) & MapViewer (v4.1.1):**
* **[UI-103]** Reconstructed the decoupled Settings Modal (`#settings-modal`).
* **[MAP-91]** Engineered global `polygonOpacity` React state. Bound the slider directly into the `MapViewer` ingestion loop to allow dynamic transparency scrubbing (`0.1` to `1.0`) on spatial layers, optimizing visual analysis.
* **[UI-104]** Overhauled VibeMonitor trajectory bounds. Hard-coded `useEffect` to spawn monitor strictly at `window.innerWidth - 340` by `window.innerHeight - 300` on boot, safely forcing it to the bottom-right corner without disrupting the `top/left` absolute drag vectors.

**ContentSlider (v4.2.0):**
* **[UI-105]** Compressed `.unified-status-bar` vertical height from `40px` to `32px`. Shrunk interactive `.status-btn` parameters to `28x28px`.
* **[UI-106]** Architecturally partitioned the About Modal into semantic modules (Dataset Overview, Core Engine Telemetry, Usage & Parameters). Injected `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for the `aboutData.title`.
* **[UI-107]** Reconstructed the Logo-Lockup Typography. Utilized `align-items: baseline` to perfectly lock the `CarTiMapper` logotype and version integer. Stripped native bold tags from global UI.
* **[UI-108]** Rewrote the Back/Rewind (`↺`) SVG vector path to shorten the radial arc, preventing optical confusion.

### [v6.8.1] - DOM Collision & UI Standardization Patch

**TimelineScrubber (v24.1.0):**
* **[UI-89]** Swapped spatial window control order to standard OS paradigm (Minimize `[_]` ➔ Maximize/Restore `[□]`).
* **[UI-90]** Implemented strict responsive `@media (max-height: 500px)` query for Android landscape orientation. Automatically un-stacks temporal zoom controls into a horizontal flex-row to prevent bottom-axis clipping.
* **[UI-91]** Repositioned the minimized Timeline Floating Action Button (FAB) to the absolute bottom-right. Injected `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` to guarantee OS-level chrome (Safari URL bars, Android navigation) never occludes the touch target.
* **[UI-92]** Applied `line-height: 0` and `display: block` to all SVG button containers, mathematically neutralizing phantom typographical baselines and achieving perfect pixel centering.
* **[UI-93]** Restored full-height spatial consumption for the timeline track. The outer wrapper reverts to `height: 100%`, while the inner `.timeline-track-container` dynamically scales via `min-height` based on active swimlane counts.

**MapViewer (v4.1.0):**
* **[MAP-87]** Repositioned the dynamic radar Minimap to absolute `bottom-left` (`left: 15px`), acting as a geometric counter-weight to the right-aligned zoom/layer controls.
* **[MAP-88]** Hardened the Layers overlay menu against viewport decapitation. Injected `max-height: 50vh; overflow-y: auto;`, forcing internal scrolling rather than clipping behind the `overflow: hidden` map bounds.
* **[MAP-89]** Stripped `stroke` rendering from WKT Polygons to render pure, borderless fills. 
* **[MAP-90]** Recalibrated Polyline `dashArray` to `8, 8`, enforcing a perfect 1:1 pixel/gap ratio for maximum contrast over complex basemaps.

**ContentSlider (v4.1.0) & AppOrchestrator (v1.51.0):**
* **[UI-94]** Upgraded the Splash Screen data injector. Replaced generic hardcoded text with active parsing of the Headless CMS payload (`aboutData.title`). Massively scaled the SVG logo to `500px` (clamped to `80vw`).
* **[UI-95]** Architecturally partitioned the About Modal into three semantic hierarchies: Dataset Overview, Core Engine Telemetry, and Usage & Parameters (restoring Deep-Link URL instructions).
* **[UI-96]** Re-engineered the Back (`↺`) SVG navigation icon. Shortened the geometric path arc to widen the white-space gap, ensuring it reads distinctly as a directional arrow at mobile scales.
* **[UI-97]** Purged legacy `|` CSS border pipes from the temporal Span readout in the Status Bar.
* **[UI-98]** Stripped all native `font-weight` (bolding) from the global Status Bar About button. Flex-anchored the version integer to the bottom (`align-items: flex-end`).

**System Telemetry (VibeMonitor v2.1.1):**
* **[PERF-13]** Overhauled spatial drag math. Deprecated `bottom` calculation vectors and anchored the monitor strictly to `top` and `left` viewport client coordinates, permanently neutralizing the mathematical inversion bug that launched the HUD off-screen during upward drags.

### [v6.8.0] - The Architectural Consolidation Compile
*   **Core UI / Engine:**
    *   **[UI-80]** Purged custom/local overlays from the `DEFAULT_BASEMAPS` registry. Standardized global WebGIS basemaps (Carto, Esri, OSM, Protomaps).
    *   **[UI-82]** Ripped out all OS-dependent emojis across the entire platform. Replaced with raw, color-inheriting SVGs for cross-platform contrast and dimensional stability.
    *   **[UI-87]** Deployed strict CSS resets (`-webkit-appearance: none`) and "phantom hitboxes" to all interactive buttons to prevent Android text-scaling bloat while preserving 44px+ mobile touch targets.
*   **MapViewer (v4.0.0):**
    *   **[MAP-85]** Integrated dynamic, on-demand loading for MapLibre GL JS to support WebGL rendering of Protomaps vector tiles.
    *   **[MAP-86]** Rerouted vector rendering to consume a local `style.json` to enable advanced cartographic layer casing and dynamic zoom interpolation.
*   **TimelineScrubber (v24.0.0):**
    *   **[UI-85]** Refactored control clusters. Split spatial window controls (Minimize/Maximize) from temporal navigation (Zoom/Lock).
    *   **[UI-86]** Engineered "Drawer" collapse mechanics. Added a Floating Action Button (FAB) to restore the timeline when minimized to `0px`.
    *   **[UI-84]** Added an SVG media indicator to timeline event blocks if the associated data contains photos or video.
*   **MediaViewer (v2.11.0):**
    *   **[UI-83]** Extracted external source links and the active image counter from individual carousel nodes. Locked them to a floating, top-right spatial axis for consistent accessibility.
    *   **[PERF-12]** Implemented passive `onScroll` tracking to update the active media index, allowing the browser GPU to handle CSS scroll-snapping natively.
*   **System Telemetry:**
    *   **[UI-81]** Upgraded the `VibeMonitor` into a persistent, draggable HUD. Replaced absolute coordinates with fixed z-indexing to prevent clipping beneath the map canvas. Added a standard `[ X ]` close control.

### [v6.7.5]
* **Style Engine (style.json v1.0.0) [MAP-86]:** Engineered and deployed a custom MapLibre-compatible stylesheet for Protomaps vector data. 
* **Cartographic Upgrade:** Implemented Layer Casing for minor roads and major highways, allowing for dynamic pixel-width scaling across zoom levels 8 through 18.
* **Safety & Versioning:** Embedded a `metadata` object block at the root and layer levels to provide in-line documentation and version tracking without violating strict JSON syntax rules.

### [v6.7.2]
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.50.1) [MAP-81]:** Deployed a native URI decoding mechanism (`decodeURIComponent`) within the `Papa.parse` Web Map Service (WMS) extraction matrix. This intercepts and cleans double-encoded URL characters (e.g., converting `%3A` back to `:`) originating from user-sniffed Network payloads. This sanitization prevents literal string collisions within the Leaflet `L.tileLayer.wms()` WebGL rendering engine.

### [v6.7.1]
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.50.0) [MAP-80]:** Updated the `DEFAULT_BASEMAPS` schema and the `Papa.parse` block to ingest `format` and `wmsLayer` metadata. Injected the Dipylon 'Karten von Attika (Kaupert)' map configuration into the default registry.
* **MapViewer (v3.30.0) [MAP-80]:** Refactored the `activeOverlays` rendering loop. Engineered a conditional router that intercepts WMS definitions and redirects them to the `L.tileLayer.wms` method, enabling real-time, bounding-box-driven institutional tile generation alongside standard XYZ overlays.

### [v6.7.0]
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.49.0) [UI-72]:** Deployed `maxPane` and `expandedTimelineHeight` global states. Added a heavily scoped `<style>` block to execute state-driven CSS Flexbox overrides for maximum layout expansion, replacing the need for JS-based width calculations. Disabled pane resizers when a maximization state is active.
* **MapViewer (v3.29.0) [UI-72]:** Injected the `[⛶]` expansion SVG into the Unified HUD, mapping directly to the `setMaxPane` toggle.
* **MediaViewer (v2.10.0) [UI-72]:** Added the expansion SVG to the absolute-positioned top-right floating array.
* **ContentSlider (v3.20.0) [UI-72]:** Added the expansion SVG to the top-left status bar next to the Settings toggle.
* **TimelineScrubber (v23.18.0) [UI-72]:** Injected the `isTimelineExpanded` boolean toggle into the bottom-left map controls. Deployed the dynamic `useEffect` math calculation to multiply active lanes by lane-height, pushing the result to the Orchestrator's `expandedTimelineHeight` state.

### [v6.6.8]
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.48.0) [UI-71]:** Upgraded the CMS registry parser to ingest a `DefaultOpacity` column, defaulting to `1.0` if null or malformed.
* **MapViewer (v3.28.0) [UI-71]:** Added the `overlayOpacities` state dictionary. Injected an isolated range slider into the active overlay HUD. Bound the Leaflet `setOpacity()` method to a `useEffect` synchronization loop, granting users physical sub-pixel control over layer transparency.

### [v6.6.7]
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.47.0) [CMS-06]:** Expanded the Google Sheets CMS parser to ingest three new columns: `Active`, `AttrText`, and `AttrLink`. Deployed a Lazy Boolean regex evaluator to safely parse empty CMS cells into inactive layer states.
* **MapViewer (v3.27.0) [CMS-06]:** Rewrote the initialization `useEffect` to dynamically set `activeBasemap` and `activeOverlays` strictly from the incoming CMS state flags. Restructured the Layers Menu DOM to place `AttrText` outside the interactive `<label>`, injecting `e.stopPropagation()` into the anchor tags to prevent layer-toggling event collisions.

### ChangeLog [v6.6.6]
* **MapViewer (v3.26.0) [CMS-05]:** Deprecated the vertically stacked attribution UI layout. Deployed an inline DOM structure, combining Map Labels and Attribution Hyperlinks onto a unified horizontal axis to reduce the Map HUD's overall vertical pixel consumption by ~40%.

### ChangeLog [v6.6.4]
* **MapViewer (v3.24.1) [CRASH-01]:** Fixed a fatal Leaflet initialization crash caused by `MarkerCluster` querying a missing `maxZoom` property. Deployed the `maxGlobalZoom` integer calculation to scan the CMS array and lock the map's absolute zoom ceiling. Upgraded all `L.tileLayer` injections to utilize `maxNativeZoom`, unlocking native tile-stretching for global basemaps beneath deep historical overlays.

### ChangeLog [v6.6.3]
* **MapViewer (v3.24.0) [UI-70]:** Deployed the vertical "Sandwich" matrix for Leaflet zoom controls. Replaced the minimalist Feather layer icon with a solid isometric SVG stack. Swapped the SVG graticule back to a universal `🌐` text emoji per design specification.

### ChangeLog [v6.6.2]
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.45.0) [CMS-02]:** Upgraded the CMS URL payload handler. The secondary fetch loop now mathematically checks incoming basemap IDs against defaults, updating bounds for existing IDs and safely appending new ones without overwriting the static global defaults.
* **MapViewer (v3.23.0) [CMS-03]:** Dismantled scattered HUD artifacts. Deployed the Unified top-right control stack (Zoom Level, Focus, Grid, Layers). Engineered the dual-state tile loop to stack unchecked `base` and arrayed `overlay` layers, forcing Leaflet Z-Index priority.

* ### ChangeLog [v6.6.0]
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.44.0) [CMS-01]:** Converted the linear data fetch into a concurrent `Promise.all()` pipeline to support the `&bgid=` URL parameter. Updated `basemapsRegistry` state to dynamically overwrite the default hardcoded array if secondary CMS data is detected. Hardcoded defaults now include the georeferenced `athens-1944` layer via Allmaps.
* **MapViewer (v3.22.0) [CMS-01]:** Decoupled internal tile configs from the static `BASEMAPS` object. The component now accepts `basemapsRegistry` as a direct prop, extracting dynamic `url`, `maxZoom`, and `attribution` bounds in real-time as the user toggles settings.

### [v6.5.1]
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.43.0) [UI-67]:** Instantiated the `showButtonText` state variable and injected its toggle controller into the Settings Modal UI to support Minimalist Mode.
* **MapViewer (v3.21.0) [UI-67, UI-68]:** Replaced the Map HUD text labels with custom Globe (Grid) and Crosshair (Zoom) SVGs. Hooked the Grid label render logic into the global `showButtonText` state.
* **ContentSlider (v3.19.0) [UI-67, UI-69]:** Injected the `margin-left: auto` fluid spacer into the Micro-Scroll Ribbon, restoring the Date (Left) / Metadata (Right) split. Replaced the Back button icon with a standard UI `↺` SVG. Wired bottom navigation buttons to the `showButtonText` toggle.
* **TimelineScrubber (v23.17.0) [UI-68, UI-69]:** Compressed the dynamic telemetry output string to `Span: X`. Replaced the emoji-based zoom locks with distinct, state-driven Padlock SVGs for immediate visual feedback.

### ChangeLog [v6.5.0]
* **GlobalStyles (v4.13.0) [UI-65, UI-66]: Deployed CSS state classes for .metadata-ribbon to control horizontal scroll concealment. Implemented UI structural elements for #search-modal, inputs, and history buttons.
* **MapViewer (v3.20.0) [DATA-05]: Injected formatPlaces() to the Tooltip render loop, strictly enforcing first-comma truncation for map labeling independently from memory.
* **ContentSlider (v3.18.0) [UI-65, UI-66]: Activated the onScroll threshold sensor for the dynamic header matrix. Engineered the Omni-Search modal component, wiring it into the bottom-right status bar in a [Search] [Back] [Counter] flex layout. Activated localStorage parsing for cross-session search history persistence.

### ChangeLog [v6.4.28]
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.42.0) [MAP-11]:** Converted the legacy UI toggle into a fully descriptive `<select>` dropdown menu labeled "Map υπόβαθρο". Added rich descriptive text for the 5 curated providers to assist user decisions.
* **MapViewer (v3.19.0) [MAP-11]:** Implemented the `BASEMAPS` Core Registry array. The Leaflet engine now safely un-mounts and mounts independent tile providers in real-time, perfectly synchronizing the UI choice across both the main geographic viewport and the minimap radar.

### ChangeLog [v6.4.27]
* **MapViewer (v3.18.0) [MAP-10]:** Implemented the Minimum Projection Math clamp to the Custom Minimap. The blue aiming viewport is now allowed to expand indefinitely when zoomed out, but will mathematically halt its contraction at exactly `30px`, ensuring perfect visibility at extreme zoom depths.
* **MapViewer:** Updated UI label on the spatial overlay button from `Lat/Lon` to `Grid`.

### ChangeLog [v6.4.26]
* **MapViewer (v3.17.2) [MAP-09]:** Resolved the "dead setting" bug in the dynamic radar. Wired the `minimapOffset` to a live `useRef` and added a standalone `useEffect` that forces the `miniMapInstance` to instantly recalculate and snap to the new zoom depth the second the user adjusts the dropdown.
* **GlobalStyles (v4.12.1) [UI-64]:** Injected a mobile-exclusive `@media` query to radically shrink the minimap to `90px` by `65px` on phones, preventing DPI multiplication from artificially inflating the module into a massive obstruction.

### [v6.4.25]
* **MapViewer (v3.17.1) [MAP-08]:** Replaced the static, frozen minimap initialization with a synchronized Dynamic Radar engine. The secondary `miniMap` instance now actively tracks the main map's `getCenter()` and applies the user-selected `minimapOffset` (from `-2` to `-8`), ensuring the blue bounding rectangle never shrinks into oblivion during deep zooms.

### ChangeLog [v6.4.24]
* **MapViewer (v2.10.0) [MAP-08]:** Deployed Dynamic Radar tracking. The minimap now actively intercepts main map pan/zoom events, scaling the blue aiming rectangle proportionately instead of shrinking into oblivion.
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.41.0) [UI-63]:** Added the `minimapOffset` state array. Injected a new `<select>` dropdown into the Settings Modal allowing seamless selection of minimap radar depth from `-2` to `-8` levels.
* **GlobalStyles (v4.12.0) [UI-62]:** Injected the absolute geometric `!important` containment cage over `.leaflet-control-minimap`, permanently terminating the Android "Exploding Map" bug.

### ChangeLog [v6.4.22]
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.40.0) [URL-02]:** Engineered the Deep-Link Omni-Parser. Solved the "Android URL Parameter Bug" by actively scanning both URL queries and Hash strings, while natively correcting `&amp;` corruptions injected by mobile messaging applications.

### ChangeLog [v6.4.21]
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.39.2) [UI-61]:** Added `touch-action: none;` CSS physical override to all resizer elements. This successfully intercepts and blocks native Android browser scroll hijacking, unlocking perfectly fluid touch-drag resizing on tablet and mobile hardware.

### ChangeLog [v6.4.18]
* **ContentSlider (v3.17.2) [UI-58]:** Compressed the visual boundary between the sticky header metadata and the primary description body by reducing top padding to `0.2rem`.
* **MediaViewer (v2.9.0) [MED-25]:** Enhanced the native CSS media gallery swiping by injecting a `touchMove` telemetry lock. Sliding an image firmly blocks the Left/Right click-zones from triggering an accidental double-jump navigation.

### ChangeLog [v6.4.16]
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.38.0) [MED-11]:** Replaced legacy comma-based `.split(/[;,]\s+/)` logic with the Omni-Splitter (`/[\r\n]+|\\n/`). Media, Captions, and Credits now strictly delimit via new-lines, preventing URLs containing commas from fracturing.
* **AppOrchestrator:** Resolved the persistent metadata loss bug by physically mapping `media caption` and `media credit` to `mediaCaption` and `mediaCredit` inside the compiled JSON array, perfectly matching the required prop schema for the `MediaViewer` rendering loop.
* **AppOrchestrator:** Fully restored the original, mathematically complex SVG vector for the `CarTiMapperLogo`, abandoning the primitive triangle placeholder. Reapplied the 4px aesthetic spacing.

### [v6.4.15]
* **Full Application (Baseline Reconciliation):** Performed a forensic state-reconciliation against the `v6.3.10` baseline file. Successfully integrated the "Reading Room" layout architecture (v6.4.12), the Hero Overhang text pane (v6.4.11), and the Same-Day Smart Dates (v6.4.9) while completely restoring all original internal logic that was dropped during layout rewrites.
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.37.0):** Restored the `status.isFading` class injection to reinstate smooth Splash Screen transitions. Corrected CSV mapping keys from `caption/credit` to `media caption/media credit` to match the exact v6.3.10 CSV schema and revive media text. Remounted the physical `SettingsModal` and `VibeMonitor` DOM nodes. Re-bound all 15 missing state variables and navigation props (`slideHistory`, `goBack`, `isAboutOpen`, etc.) to the `ContentSlider` execution node.
* **ContentSlider (v3.17.0):** Refined the Smart Date logic, officially merging the legacy year/month deduplication logic (`15 - 18 Mar 1944`) with the new Same-Day time delta math (`15:45 — 16:00`). Restored the physical HTML blocks for the About Modal overlay, resolving the broken button trigger.

### [v6.4.14]
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.36.2) [DATA-09]:** Restored missing `caption` and `credit` extraction logic inside the CSV mapping loop. Media metadata now correctly parses and renders alongside images.
* **AppOrchestrator [DIAG-02]:** Repaired the About button visibility bug. Restored the `setAboutData` manifest injection that occurs post-fetch, ensuring the modal overlay correctly populates and renders.
* **AppOrchestrator [URL-01]:** Restored the Deep-Linking Engine. The URL interceptor once again actively reads `?slide=` and `?date=` parameters upon boot, mathematically jumping the user to the requested index before the loading screen fades.

### [v6.4.13]
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.36.1) [UI-52]:** Patched the rotation glitch. The application now actively tracks the `1024px` CSS boundary and mechanically resets all resizer variables to `50%` upon crossing it, preventing the panes from crushing during rotation or window-snapping.
* **AppOrchestrator [UI-53]:** Fixed missing `activeSlide` prop assignment that was causing media to render as undefined. Engineered the Dynamic Collapse architecture. The Media pane and secondary drag-bar now entirely vanish when no media is present, granting `100%` of the quadrant to the Map.
* **AppOrchestrator [UI-54]:** Restored the missing Timeline resizer bar, injecting "Bottom-Up" delta math to perfectly calculate container height changes.

### [v6.4.12]
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.36.0) [UI-51]:** Deployed the "Reading Room" architectural layout. Replaced legacy hardcoded grid wrappers with dynamic CSS Flexbox media queries (`<style>` block injection). On screens wider than 1024px, the text pane dynamically snaps to the left column, while the Map and Media panes stack in the right column, maximizing screen real-estate.
* **AppOrchestrator [UI-51]:** Engineered Fluid Dynamic Resizers. Primary and Secondary drag-bars instantly detect the browser's portrait/landscape mode and mathematically invert their axis tracking (X-delta vs Y-delta) on the fly, preventing navigation failure during responsive window scaling.

### [v6.4.11]
* **ContentSlider (v3.16.0) [UI-49]:** Deployed the "Hero Overhang" aesthetic. Wrapped the Sticky Header in a `max-width: 90ch` container, keeping the Date and Metadata elements visually anchored to the `75ch` narrative text column, while allowing long titles to elegantly expand past the reading margins.
* **ContentSlider [UI-50]:** Restored the physical HTML DOM nodes for the `aboutModal` overlay, fixing a UI break where the About state triggered successfully but had no physical overlay to render.

### [v6.4.10]
* **Documentation [PROT-01]:** Decoupled the ChangeLog back into a dedicated file. Embedded a strict protocol directive requiring all architectural and historical tracking to be delivered exclusively in isolated `.md` syntax blocks to prevent UI formatting corruption.
* **ContentSlider (v3.15.0) [UI-39]:** **CRITICAL FIX:** Resolved the Sticky Header failure. Removed the infinitely stretching `.content-scroll-area` intermediate wrapper. The header is now a direct child of the `overflow-y` parent container, mechanically guaranteeing it freezes at `top: 0` during active scrolling.
* **ContentSlider [UI-48]:** Refined typographical and geometric metadata hierarchies. The Date string was stripped of bold styling (`font-weight: 400`). Places and Tags were relocated into a dedicated Flexbox column governed by `align-items: flex-end`, forcing them to stack perfectly flush against the right-hand boundary.

### [v6.4.9]
* **Documentation [PROT-01]:** Decoupled documentation into two distinct files (`Master Blueprint` and `ChangeLog`). Appended a strict directive requiring all documentation to be delivered exclusively in `.md` format.
* **ContentSlider (v3.14.0) [UI-39]:** Reordered the Sticky Header. The visual hierarchy now explicitly presents Date, Places, and Tags *above* the Event Title. Compressed padding to shrink-wrap the header and maximize reading space.
* **ContentSlider [UI-47]:** Deployed the `75ch` Readability Clamp. Narrative descriptions dynamically center and restrict their maximum width on large desktop screens to prevent eye-tracking fatigue, keeping vertical scrolling intact.
* **ContentSlider [UI-32]:** Patched the same-day Smart Date bug. `15:45 — 16:00` deltas now render cleanly without duplicating the calendar date.
* **ContentSlider [UI-46]:** Shifted the `☰ Menu` button to the absolute left edge of the status bar. 
* **AppOrchestrator (v1.35.1) [UI-46]:** Removed the hardcoded CSS gap from `CarTiMapperLogo` to align the version number flush with the text.

#### [v6.4.8]
ContentSlider (v3.11.0): * [FIX: UI-39] Consolidated the Title, Date, Place, and Tags into a unified Sticky Header. Right-aligned the Place and Tag metadata to save vertical space.

[FIX: UI-40] Injected Golden SVG vector icons for Tags.

[FIX: UI-46] Condenses Settings and Monitor triggers into a space-saving ☰ popover menu to accommodate portrait/mobile aspect ratios. Left the Arrow navigation and About buttons completely untouched.

### [v6.4.7] 
* **Merged and normalized

---

### [v6.4.7]
* **Project Management [PROT-02]:** Appended the "Discuss First, Code Later" directive to the Master Blueprint. All future interactions will strictly adhere to a two-step process: diagnostic strategy agreement, followed by code execution upon explicit user approval. Mechanically locks the developer AI into a diagnostic-first loop to halt version fragmentation and UI drift.

### [v6.4.6]
* **AppOrchestrator [UI-44]:** High-precision Universal Binary Translation deployed. The CSV data parser actively intercepts GitHub `/blob/` strings and mathematically forces them to `raw.githubusercontent.com` binaries, bypassing HTML wrapper page loading and serving raw image data directly to the DOM.
* **AppOrchestrator [PERF-08]:** High-precision millisecond date parsing (`ss.000`) added to strictly preserve dataset ordering during simultaneous events.

### [v6.4.5]
* **Full File:** Consolidated all experimental performance patches into a single, highly stable build.
* **MapViewer [UI-42]:** Injected a mandatory `invalidateSize()` forcing mechanism, effectively resolving the white-map tile bug by demanding Leaflet calculate its true container bounds before requesting HTTP raster data.
* **MapViewer [UI-43]:** Hardcoded strict `160px` geometric locks on the Minimap container to eliminate Flexbox aspect-ratio explosion on tablet portrait displays.
* **Architecture [PERF-07]:** Scoped `safeStripHTML` directly into map and timeline rendering loops. Eliminated external utility dependencies, resolving silent global `ReferenceError` crashes during DOM construction.

### [v6.4.4]
* **Project Management [PROT-01]:** Appended a strict Developer Protocol section to the Master Blueprint (Documentation Supremacy), legally binding the AI assistant to provide Markdown changelogs and architectural updates with every single code deployment.

### [v6.4.3]
* **TimelineScrubber (v23.17.0) [PERF-06]:** **CRITICAL FIX:** Eliminated the massive initialization freeze. Diagnosed a severe Out-Of-Memory crash caused by the repeated generation of HTML `<canvas>` objects. Hoisted the `document.createElement('canvas')` call completely out of the `formatLabelSmart` React lifecycle. The engine now uses one pre-warmed, globally immutable memory singleton (`_globalTmCtx`) to measure all 500+ timeline labels instantly.
* **ContentSlider (v3.11.0) [UI-32]:** Deployed the `formatSmartDate` engine to natively deduplicate time strings (e.g., removing redundant years/months for multi-day events and mathematically stripping `00:00` midnight signatures).
* **ContentSlider [UI-39]:** Pinned the Title and Date to the top of the UI via `position: sticky`. Moved the Metadata Dock directly below the header to establish strict geographic-first narrative hierarchy.
* **ContentSlider [UI-40]:** Injected the golden-yellow `<svg>` tag icon directly into the mapping loop so every Tag pill renders flawlessly, overriding unpredictable OS-dependent Emoji rendering.

### [v6.4.2] 
* **Map Engine Rewrite (v4.0.0):** Completely upgraded the Map architecture by combining three absolute performance safeguards:
    * **[PERF-05] Bulk Ingestion (The Boot Fix):** Instead of feeding the MarkerCluster one pin at a time, WKT arrays are collected in a temporary, invisible JavaScript array (`const bulkCluster = []`). Once the loop finishes, the array is handed to Leaflet in a single `clusterLayer.addLayers(bulkCluster)` command. The collision math runs exactly once instead of $O(N^2)$ times, dropping load times to milliseconds and resolving the CPU hang.
    * **[PERF-02] O(1) Spatial Tracker (The Memory Fix):** Re-implemented the delta tracker (`prevActiveIndexRef`). Changing slides updates exactly two mathematical targets on the map (promoting the new, demoting the old), leaving the remaining 500+ cluster objects untouched.
    * **[PERF-04] The Transmission Clutch (The Spam Fix):** Re-implemented the `debouncedIndex` (set to 100ms). Holding the arrow key flies the Timeline at 30fps, but the Map safely pauses before calculating heavy DOM cluster extractions and 3D flight geodesics, saving 99% of CPU overhead.
* **MapViewer [UI-38]:** Forced `miniMap.invalidateSize()` and strictly applied `fitBounds(bounds.pad(0.1), { animate: false })` to guarantee the minimap instantly and rigidly wraps around the specific geographic footprint of the dataset without aspect-ratio geometry conflicts.

### [v6.4.1]
